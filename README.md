## Setup
The project already contains all the dependencies you need for the project declared in the pyproject.toml file.
You should install them using Poetry.

## Project details:
This API will be used by a Car Finder site.
The customers of the Car Finder site would like to search different cars by Car Brand, Year, Price, Dealer location or name, Car model, etc....

## Remaining tasks:
- Create at least 5 car brands.
- Create at least 3 cars per brand.
- Create at least 3 Car Dealers (A dealer is a shop that sells cars).
- Create at least 5 Listings per Car Dealer.
- Create an endpoint that returns all the listings.
- Allow the 'listings' endpoint to filter by Car Brand Name, Car Model, Listing year, Listing Price, Listing Color, Dealer name, Dealer location.
- Add unit tests for the 'listings' endpoint.

### Notes:
- Create the data by using any possible method, via Django Admin, the Django shell, a python script or whatever you consider easier.

- For the unit tests, you don't need to have 100% coverage, but think about which aspects of this endpoint are most important to test.


- Important note: There are some hidden bugs in the code :D happy hunthing!
